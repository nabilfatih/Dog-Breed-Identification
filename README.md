# Dog Breed Identification

Determine the breed of a dog in an image using TensorFlow 2.X and Transfer Learning

Who's a good dog? Who likes ear scratches? Well, it seems those fancy deep neural networks don't have all the answers. 
However, maybe they can answer that ubiquitous question we all ask when meeting a four-legged stranger: what kind of good pup is that?

It's a virtual environment, i've already install all the tools that needed for this project using `conda` and `pip` for TensorFlow. 
you can easily use this environment.

## Tools:

* Pandas: `conda install pandas`
* Matplotlib: `conda install matplotlib`
* NumPy: `conda install numpy`
* Scikit-Learn: `conda install scikit-learn`
* TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow`
* TensorFlow Hub: `pip install --upgrade tensorflow-hub`
